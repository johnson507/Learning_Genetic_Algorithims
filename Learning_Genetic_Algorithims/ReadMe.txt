    CONSOLE APPLICATION : Learning_Genetic_Algorithims Project Overview
========================================================================

This project is a basic genetic algorithm that can guess strings. At the moment, it is hardcoded to only work for strings, but I will continue to expand and improve 
this project.

The console application takes a string, and the number of times to run the program for benchmarking purposes. Then it will find the solution and track
the number of times it took to find the answer, then average it based on the number of times it was run.
